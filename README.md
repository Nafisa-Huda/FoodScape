## Lessons Learned 

This application strengthened my knowledge of connecting frontend development with backend development. I wanted to build a visually pleasing UI and allow users to interact with the application. To strengthen my frontend skills, I created an emoji background animation and a modal for users to input their restaurant's data. To strengthen my backend skills, I included a database to store the users' inputs and included two routes.
